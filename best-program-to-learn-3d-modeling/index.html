<p>3d modeling is the use of computers to create images and graphics that look to have three dimensions. Some examples of programs that can help 3d modeling professionals produce these drawings include autodesk fusion 360, autocad, and unity, along with physical tools such as drawing tablets. This tool allows beginners to import or export videos in mpeg, quicktime, and avi file formats. If you’re an intermediate 3d designer, we would suggest a program with a less steep learning curve.</p>
