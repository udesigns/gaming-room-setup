<p>One of the bigger problems is that the discs in between our lumbar vertebrae start to bulge which usually becomes a chronic problem. Although it might seem like sitting down would be a way to ease pain your body is actually made to move and inactivity is actually worse for the back pain we might be experiencing. Although sitting does not cause upper back pain but yes sitting for long hours repeatedly can cause upper back pain whether it is sitting on a chair couch or while driving. The lower back bears the brunt of the strain. Pin On Fitness.</p>
