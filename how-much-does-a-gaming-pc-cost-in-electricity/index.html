<p>The cost to build a gaming pc with an intel budget build costs around $305 to $385. The average energy consumption of a gaming pc is around 1,400 kwh per year. First, we need to calculate annual pc energy consumption e kwh/year and than multiply it by electricity cost per kwh cost kwh. Mgmt may be interested to know that at the low end (17w) each pc costs an extra $10/year in electricity (assuming running the 16 hours outside of the work day for 365 days, at $0.10/kwh).</p>
<h3 id="since-the-average-cost-of-electricity-is-around-28-centskwh-here-in-san-diego-my-weekly-cost-is-roughly">Since the average cost of electricity is around 28 cents/kwh here in san diego, my weekly cost is roughly:</h3><p>So, how much does it cost to let a gaming pc run the entire day? Why do gaming computers drain so much power? This means that if a pc is on for eight hours a day, it will cost 10p a day to run the laptop (based on an average energy unit cost of 12.5 p/kwh). A desktop pc typically uses around 100 watts of electricity, the equivalent of 0.1 kwh. The electricity calculator below helps you work out how much it costs for the electricity needed to run a range of household appliances. 11.02 kwh x $0.28/kwh = $3.08 per week we can then estimate a yearly figure ($3.08 x 52.</p>
