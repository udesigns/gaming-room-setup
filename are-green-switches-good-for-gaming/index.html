<h3 id="razer-is-a-company-known-for-its-gaming-equipment-so-it-goes-without-saying-that-they-will-have-manufactured-their-own-loud-mechanical-switches-for-the-ideal-gaming-experience">Razer is a company known for its gaming equipment so it goes without saying that they will have manufactured their own loud mechanical switches for the ideal gaming experience.</h3><p>Yellow is the top for pure gaming. As i mentioned before, the razer green is one of my favorite clicky switches, with 50 grams of actuation force, 1.9mm actuation point and 4mm of travel distance. Overall, the razer green switches are a great option if you want a loud mechanical switch, whether it be for gaming or typing, although there are some small drawbacks for gaming. For many decades, the brand has been providing us with outstanding key technology to help enhance our gaming experience. I used green, yellow and orange switches. Yellow is very silent but typing feels weird.</p>
