            <p>I believe that to get 4k at 60fps over hdmi, you&amp;#039;d need a graphics card that supports hdmi 2.0. Here are the basics you need to start your search for a new monitor for work or play.</p>

I believe that to get 4k at 60fps over hdmi, you�d need a graphics card that supports hdmi 2.0. But, you might also want to ask yourself if you actually need a 4k monitor. If you want to connect other devices to the port simultaneously, it’s unlikely to provide enough bandwidth.</p>
<h3 id="its-easy-to-get-caught-up-in-great-features">It’s easy to get caught up in great features.</h3><p>They�re great if you want that extra resolution for photo or video. I believe that to get 4k at 60fps over hdmi, you�d need a graphics card that supports hdmi 2.0. With that said, you have to choose the 4k monitor that will avoid that from happening. Gaming monitors can be used for a wide variety of things, as their connector types allow the owner to. If you want to make the jump to 4k, a high refresh rate monitor is going to be expensive. They do have their place.</p>
