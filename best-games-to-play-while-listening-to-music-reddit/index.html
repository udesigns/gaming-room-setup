<p>I really enjoyed death standing while listening to podcasts. I usually play kerbal space program and rocket league while listening music.

<p>Puzzle + audiobook + favorite beverage = utter perfection. Assassin�s creed odyssey, slay the spire, the division 2, risk of rain 2, diablo 3, and fucking borderlands. Puzzle games are usually solid, dating back to tetris (and my current one is just jewels, the mh games version on phones). The teachers tells a story and the students has to determine.</p>
