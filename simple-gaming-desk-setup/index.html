<h3 id="written-by-austin-sep-14-2021--7-min-read">Written by austin sep 14, 2021 · 7 min read.</h3><p>After unboxing your brand new xbox series x, take the main power cable and plug it into the main power cable port located in the console. The quickest and easiest method is to pick up one or two signum wire trays while you’re at ikea. You can fit a computer desk with a gaming chair, some targeted led lights, maybe some bean bags, and shelving to hold all your video games, board. Stick with decor that’s functional over just aesthetically pleasing. There are game pad hooks on the wall, and clever use of wire mold on the walls to hide the cables (without having to put holes on the walls to run the cables). A huge standing desk, two monster pcs where one is dedicated for gaming and the other for streaming and editing, plus console and mobile gaming compatibility with easy stream switching in 4k resolution, what more can you ask for?</p>
