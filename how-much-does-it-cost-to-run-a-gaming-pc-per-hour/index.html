<h3 id="as-a-general-rule-most-desktop-computers-will-have-a-minimum-idle-usage-of-80wh-costing-around-23c-per-hour">As a general rule, most desktop computers will have a minimum idle usage of 80wh, costing around 2.3c per hour.</h3><p>To summarise this, a desktop computer (including the monitor) will cost at least 10.2c per hour in electricity to operate. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a desktop computer using 100 watts for 6 hours a day @ $0.10 per kwh. When a pc is under strain, however, it consumes up to 300wh at a cost of 8.6c per hour. In the us, the average cost of electricity is about 13 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh), a measurement of electricity usage over time. Laptop (charge) 30w x 4 hours per day = 44. So if you were in the uk and electricity is 15p per kwh, then the power hungry xbox one x at full power would be £0.027 per hour, if you play 3hours a day its £30 for the year.</p>
