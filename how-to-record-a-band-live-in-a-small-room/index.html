<p>I opted for the most effective (isolating) solution → two 2×4 walls @ 24” on center, spaced 1” apart, a room within a room. One of the best ways to capture a live show is mixing audience microphones in with a soundboard feed. This lets the drummer see what the bassist is doing without the big cymbals (ride or china).</p>

<p>The reality is that thousands of small venues are spread out over the united states. Don’t place them on different surfaces, otherwise your. The inside room is a standalone room, roughly 10’x14’, completely isolated from the rest of the townhouse (untouching). A good rule of thumb for live performances is to place the microphone between 4 to 6 inches away.</p>

<p>Once you orient the band on an imaginary stage in your rehearsal space, placing loudspeakers as floor monitors at the front of the room will provide a better listening experience for your singer and keyboardist (if applicable), while still giving enough coverage for the rest of the band to hear them. My recommendation is that you put yourself closer to.</p>

<p>That, in itself, warrants an entire article which i typed up previously, see here: Ideally you want to have this room as isolated from outside sound intrusions as possible. Don’t place them on different surfaces, otherwise your. Also, make it your number one priority to be interesting. One is placed as close as possible to the middle of the cone.</p>
