<p>And since some rooms are better for recording than others. A soundboard (also known as a mixing board, mix console or sound desk) is a complex and sometimes intimidating piece of equipment. Point the back of the mic (the point of maximum rejection) so that it’s aimed toward the centre of the room, or where the other musicians are set. As a bonus the cable will lay down on the floor without loops standing up to trip over.</p>
<h3 id="drums-are-a-difficult-thing-to-mix-live">Drums are a difficult thing to mix live.</h3><p>For a good small room, i prefer to mic the kick drum, as well as the snare. Since every setup will be a little different, we recommend you view each and then determine which type of configuration works best for your setup. When setting up the stage for your band, try to keep cabling out of the band’s playing area as much as possible by keeping it to the sides and off stage, etc. It is so difficult to find bands that can manage their volume (without sounding terrible), that the ones who can will find it isn�t at all hard to stay busy in smaller rooms. Because a small room can put you right on top of both patrons and the bar, volume is usually the number one priority on every small gig. This lets the drummer see what the bassist is doing without the big cymbals (ride or china) blocking the view.</p>

<p>To get the audio signal into the pa speakers you will need a mixer, which come in many different types. Opening all doors and windows is an easy way of keeping the room ventilated. Systems with large subwoofers are only really suitable for large studio spaces. Have a plan for gear coming off stage during the concert. It is so.</p>

<p>If it is just your band on stage, you may not need to tape the flat laying cables. Rather than running separate mics for both pa and recorded vocals, simply connect a cable from your pa mixer’s main outputs to an open track on your recorder. For rooms up to around 3 metres long i’d suggest monitors with between 4.</p>

<li>a classic band setup is to have the bassist stand to the left of the drummer. Raise the input gain slowly until you hear a ringing noise from the speaker system. After sound is set up, tape or otherwise cover any cables that will be in place for the whole concert. Because practice is so crucial, perhaps the most.</li>
