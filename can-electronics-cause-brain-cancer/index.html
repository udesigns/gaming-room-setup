<p><strong>Can Electronics Cause Brain Cancer</strong>, I dont in case. Phones emit radio frequency energy which some scientists believe could increase the risk of brain cancer and tumours of the acoustic nerve and salivary glands. They based their statement on findings that using a cell phone for 10 years doubles the risk of developing a form of cancerous brain tumor called a glioma the same type that killed Ted Kennedy. These are tumours where the tumour cells grow more rapidly and are more likely to spread within the brain.</p>

<p>According to western medicine brain cancer is when too many cells grow in the brain tissue. One growing area of concern is the research evidence showing that human brains may be harmed by overexposure to the actual electronic devices themselves and that children are especially susceptible. The shortest answer is no. For the past 40 years or so Ive been working 810 hours a day almost every day in front of a computer screen.</p>
