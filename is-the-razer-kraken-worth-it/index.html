Should i buy the Razer Kraken X headset,is it worth it?How From reddit.com</p>
<p>The kraken ultimate costs $129.99 (£129.99, aus$195), putting it at the pricier end of razer’s headset offerings. The kraken 7.1 chroma i have sounds better with the factory eq than the beats mixer pros i have owned, along with some sennheiser 449 a roommate lent me for a while after the clumsy turtle beach x12 (awful brand, by the way, from the box i knew i was in for a disappointment) broke. I was able to get some really good sound stage out of it and some sound it’s, a good directional cues, so meaning i was able to determine the direction that gunshots were coming from footsteps above below to the left to the right. Despite being at the lower end of the scale in terms of price, both the razer kraken x and razer kraken x lite offer some cool features.</p>
<h3 id="this-popular-razer-headset-is-lightweight-and-despite-the-large-earcups-you-can-wear-them-comfortably-for-long-gaming-sessions">This popular razer headset is lightweight and despite the large earcups, you can wear them comfortably for long gaming sessions.</h3><p>It�s a very good headset. Just have to cope with the white noise and the statics that occur every 2 hours which does not feel worthwhile. But you will need to ask yourself if the haptic response is worth an additional 30% price jump. The te has a usb dac, but the actual headset has a 3.5mm jack, so you can plug it to something else, too, when you don�t want thx. What razer has made is just a plastic piece of junk. Razer kraken x the x is a worthy addition to the kraken range, and it impresses with that virtual 7.1 surround sound and low price.</p>

<p>The razer kraken v3 hypersense gaming headset offers excellent sound quality and clear mic pickup, a comfortable fit, and the characteristic razer style that will make a great addition to any pc gamer�s setup. But none of this means the kraken is bad, far from it. I have the kraken x v2 and i think it is pretty good value.</p>

<p>I have the kraken x v2 and i think it is pretty good value for the money. I mean it�s not going to come close sound wise to a hifi headphone or high end bluetooth set, but that�s not what it is for. So in terms of sound the razer kraken’s kind of an oddball because you seem in games.</p>
