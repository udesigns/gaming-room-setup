How can I split my Steam Library across multiple portable From gaming.stackexchange.com</p>
<p>Steam will work on an external drive, and will run perfectly fine as long as you�re not trying to simultaneously run it from the computer�s internal drive. If the games are on your harddrive and exist in (…tosteamdirectory\steam\steamapps\common\) , when you press “install” on a game you have installed and not detected by steam, the installation would turn into “detecting existing files…” and then you could play the game without the need to download it again. Here, you can click“add library folder” and select the external hard drive you plan move to, hit “new folder” and write a directory name. Running a game off an external drive sounds painful, so i would avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-able-to-take-my-games-with-me-anywhere-and-play-them-on-any-computer">I am able to take my games with me anywhere and play them on any computer.</h3><p>Verify the specifications of your external hard drive before installing games on it. Technically speaking, yes you can! Why can’t i install games on my external hard drive? In order to store apps and games on an external hard drive, the drive needs to hold a capacity of 256gb or more and use a usb 3.0 connection. Your save games won’t be there though. Back up the game in a file on your local computer and then drag the backup files onto the usb flash drive.</p>
