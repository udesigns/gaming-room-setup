For example, 3d modelers in the film or video game industry must have above average creative and design skills, while 3d modelers in scientific fields may have a strong background in any given area of science. The major difference between these three is that blender is a free game development engine, 3ds max is a software purely used for 3d modeling, and maya is strong in animation. This is the present and the future. To succeed in 3d modeling, you need to have a workstation cpu that has a superior clock speed. Thankfully, the majority of software like maya, nuke, houdini, etc., are compatible with mac os.</p>
