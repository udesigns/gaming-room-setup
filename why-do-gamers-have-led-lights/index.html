<p>The light emitting diode, also commonly referred to by its shortened form of led, is an electronic component that has the ability to emit light (hence the name) when subject to a current.

<p>Plus, it’s the main reason why led lights are most preferred for fancy, decorative lighting on the sides of buildings in. If the voltage source is equal to the voltage drop of the led, no resistoris required. Because of this, you can�t say that leds have “resistance.” resistance is defined as the constant ratio of voltage to current in a.</p>
