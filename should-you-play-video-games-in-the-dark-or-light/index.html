<h3 id="to-prove-this-try-looking-at-the-wall-opposite-of-the-television-while-a-shows-on">To prove this, try looking at the wall opposite of the television while a show’s on.</h3><p>1600k is sunset and sunrise and 1800k is a candle.

Lay it on the floor, let it stand on the cabinet, or mount it on the back of the tv and paint your wall with light. The various scenes and backgrounds of the show have different lighting levels. I prefer playing in dark room. I don�t play in dark room anymore after i read that.</p>
