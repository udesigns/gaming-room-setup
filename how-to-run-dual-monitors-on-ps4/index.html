<p>I believe i needed to tell it to be windowed, but taking the full size of the monitor (which makes it sort of borderless windowed), as well. There are two ways you can set up dual monitors on your ps4: Why do you need the ps4 on 2 screens? The only thing i found so far (but never tested) that could potentially work, is to use a hdmi screenwall splitter/multiplexer.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-use-the-official-remote-play-application-to-stream-your-ps4-onto-another-screen-or-you-can-use-an-hdmi-splitter-to-separate-the-hdmi-video-output-into-two-screens">You can use the official remote play application to stream your ps4 onto another screen, or you can use an hdmi splitter to separate the hdmi video output into two screens.</h3><p>Now with my specific configuration, any game running on the other monitor (which is a television) will be using an xbox 360 controller only. So that both of us can enjoy fullscreen. I only play with one monitor when i play modern warfare now. If your monitor have 2 ports then no problem, if no then i believe there are hubs.

If you open your streaming software before turning your ps4 on and are having problems seeing video from your capture card, simply close the program, fire up your ps4, then open.</p>

<p>I doubt those monitors provide an option to stretch out a 16:9 feed, and you most certainly don�t want to do that.

<p>Why do you need the ps4 on 2 screens? If your monitor have 2 ports then no problem, if no then i believe there are hubs. I use win+shift+left arrow to transfer it. Your game most likely went from full screen to full screen borderless. For instance, you can have your favorite adobe photoshop opened in one screen.</p>

<p>An hdmi splitter fixes this issue by allowing you to toggle between hdmi inputs ultimately outputting to a single monitor. Try to choose newer monitors that are all the same model. You can use the official remote play application to stream your ps4 onto another screen, or you can use an hdmi splitter to separate the hdmi video output into.</p>

<p>We’re not going to list any required monitors for this multiscreen project, but we will point out the obvious: Triple screen support means one system (ps/xbox/pc),one copy of said game and the option within the game to connect 3 monitors to the said system that work as one monitor. Question dual monitor connection problems: Choose the connection you need at.</p>

<p>You can find both 4k monitors for the ps4 pro or 1080p options if you have the standard ps4. The internet can be pretty neat sometimes. Question connect to asus monitor from old graphics card: Connect pc via whatever you have left (hdmi2/dp/dvi/vga etc.). Why use dual monitors in one computer?</p>

<p>Ps4 supports the popular 16:9 resolutions. Nah never figured it out. I only play with one monitor when i play modern warfare now. The internet can be pretty neat sometimes. For those who want to give a little thanks, i just set up a page over at buymeacoffee as a new way to show support.</p>

<p>Question dual monitor connection problems: One more helpful tip is to have your ps4 running before opening obs or slobs on your pc. Keep in mind that many new 4k monitors have hdmi 2.1 bandwidth, but considering the ps4 is limited to hdmi 2.0 capabilities, it�s not worth getting those models. We�ve tested over 220 monitors, and below you�ll find.</p>

I realize that the active window (which in my case is a full screen game) will always be utilizing the keyboard and mouse while running, so there wouldn�t be any cursor with which to use on my second monitor.

<p>Choose the connection you need at the moment. Why use dual monitors in one computer? I think they�ve taken the freedom and liberty thing a bit too far! I believe i needed to tell it to be windowed, but taking the full size of the monitor (which makes it sort of borderless windowed), as well. Triple screen support means one.</p>

<p>The internet can be pretty neat sometimes. The only thing i found so far (but never tested) that could potentially work, is to use a hdmi screenwall splitter/multiplexer.
