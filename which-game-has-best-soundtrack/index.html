<p><strong>Which Game Has Best Soundtrack</strong>, It has one of the most interesting and memorable soundtracks of any game i’ve ever played—but it’s so weird and distinct that it almost felt wrong to include.

<p>That said, earthbound’s music can be beautiful and complex, as evidenced by the fourside theme. The burnout series offers a lot of great music, but the best entry is arguably this release that compiled a definitive collection of punk. Ds1�s theme is more understated in a good way, still has the sense of mystery, madness and a tinge of sadness. Ridge racer type 4, we love katamari, grim fandango, final fantasy 8, and fez all fall into that category, but there�s one that rises above them all, and that is akira yamaoka�s sensational silent hill 2 soundtrack.</p>

<p>I’m also a big fan of the arms soundtrack. Sonic adventure 1 &amp; 2 Chrono trigger for the snes is also excellent. This can vary greatly based on how consistent the tracks are to the region’s theme, how memorable the melodies are, and how diverse the setlist is. World of warcraft, hands down.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for all those expansions tho i’d go with skyrim. The superfly soundtrack is one of the most influential and best selling movie soundtracks of all time. I enjoy doom eternal’s soundtrack, it really pumps me up. It blends the right tone and music background to the story levels of the game just right. Depends on your taste.</p>

<p>I enjoy doom eternal’s soundtrack, it really pumps me up. Sims 3 (base game) is very standout. For me the measure of a good soundtrack is if i find myself listening to it outside of the game.
